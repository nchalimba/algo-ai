Shell sort is fairly straight forward but may seem somewhat confusing at ﬁrst as it diﬀers from other sorting algorithms in the way it selects items to compare.

SORTING 67 8.4 Insertion Sort Insertion sort is a somewhat interesting algorithm with an expensive runtime of O(n2).

SORTING 71 Figure 8.6: Radix sort base 10 algorithm bubble sort deﬁned in§8.1). Selecting the correct sorting algorithm is usually denoted purely by eﬃciency, e.g. you would always choose merge sort over shell sort and so on. There are also other factors to look at though and these are based on the actual imple- mentation. Some algorithms are very nicely expressed in a recursive fashion, however these\nEND_RAG_SOURCE_CONTENT\n\n\nRAG_SOURCE_METADATA: {'source_key': '2bff1b4b2e83b5ff1460b6546303a15c06a2e643afbaddcc6809b09426de9415', 'source_label': 'Dsa.pdf'}\nRAG_SOURCE_CONTENT: resulting in anO(n log n) complexity. The algorithm starts by picking an item, called pivot, and moving all smaller items before it, while all greater elements after it. This is the main quick sort operation, called partition, recursively repeated on lesser and greater sub lists until their size is one or zero - in which case the list is implicitly sorted. Choosing an appropriate pivot, as for example the median element is funda- mental for avoiding the drastically reduced performance ofO(n2).

Shell sort is fairly straight forward but may seem somewhat confusing at ﬁrst as it diﬀers from other sorting algorithms in the way it selects items to compare. Figure 8.5 shows"

It has a time complexity of O(n log n) when an appropriate pivot is chosen.\n- Merge Sort: Splits a list into two similar-sized lists, sorts them, and then merges them back together with a time complexity of O(n log n).\n- Shell Sort: A more efficient variation of Insertion Sort, comparing items at varying distances, resulting in a time complexity of O(n log2 n).\n- Radix Sort: Uses buckets to sort items based on a specific property called a key, with a time complexity of O(n log n).\n\nThese algorithms are used in various applications, including databases, to efficiently organize and manage data.",

In DSA we chose to always maintain pointers (or more aptly references) to the node(s) at the head and tail of the linked list and so performing a traditional insertion to either the front or back of the linked list is anO(1) operation.
