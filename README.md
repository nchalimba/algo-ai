# AlgoAI

Welcome to **AlgoAI**! ðŸš€ A powerful Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer all your questions about **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. Whether you're a student, developer, or enthusiast, this system is here to help you understand and explore DSA concepts like never before. ðŸ’¡

With **LangChain** and **FastAPI** at its core, you can configure the system to use either **OpenAI** or **Cohere** as the LLM provider (though I highly recommend **Cohere** for a cost-effective option). ðŸ˜Ž

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**: [Visit AlgoAI](https://algo-ai.api.abubeker.com/)

## Technologies

This project is powered by a blend of cutting-edge technologies:

- **Python**
- **LangChain** & **LangGraph** (for seamless integration with various LLMs)
- **Postgres** (for storing messages)
- **Astra** (for vector storage)
- **OpenAI** (LLM provider support)
- **Cohere** (LLM provider support)
- **FastAPI** (for fast API with async support)

## Features

- ðŸ¤– **Multiple LLM Provider Support**: Choose between OpenAI and Cohere for your LLM needs, with **Cohere** being the recommended option for optimal performance.
- ðŸ“š **Diverse Source Types**: Easily add sources like Text, URLs, and PDFs to improve the system's knowledge.
- ðŸ”„ **Streaming Responses**: Enjoy real-time responses as you ask questions and get immediate answers!
- ðŸ’¾ **Vector Storage**: With **Astra DB**, the system efficiently stores vectors to power your queries.
- ðŸ“¦ **Persistent Messages**: Thanks to **Postgres**, all your interaction history is stored and easily accessible.
- âš¡ **Fast and Async**: Powered by **FastAPI**, this system handles requests quickly and efficiently, even with heavy usage.
- ðŸ”§ **Customizable Chunking Strategies**: Configure how the system breaks down and processes data for optimal results.
